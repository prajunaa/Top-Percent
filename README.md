# Top-Percent
This was a mini-project to gain experience into data science and logical thinking.

The program utilizes an algorithm to find the domain of a dataset in which the area under the curve/line is highest.

In a real life context, this code can:
  
  given hourly website traffic data, find the block of time (say 6 hours out of 24) when total visits were highest; 
  Find the period of a game where a team scored the most points in a row; 
  Find the time period (e.g., top 25% of the day) with the highest trading volume or largest price moves.

This project can be given any dataset with 2 columns.
